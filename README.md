Data analysis of trail-cam species sightings as part of a conservation research project. Data is transformed/anonymized and originally formatted in Excel. Data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations performed using Pandas and MatPlotLib.

Objectives:
1) Reformat/clean data
2) Provide overall data summary; calculate sighting frequencies of each species. Provide a breakdown of species sightings for each trail cam and/or survey area. Provide visualizations for this.
3) Test for correlations between otter sightings and other species (Are there some species that have sighted more frequently than others at the river otter sites? Provide visualizations for this.
4) If geospacial data is available, create a map of river otter sightings
